Hello!

This project is used to recreate the Samsara Time on Site report using graphQL. It’s intention is to teach me more about concurrency and golang in general. 

Project Layout
———————
timeOnSite.go - The main project that executes the time on site report
config.go - Not staged since pushing to cloud, but contains graphQL token and other configs
